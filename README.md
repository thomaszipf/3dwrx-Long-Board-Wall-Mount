This is a Long board wall Mount. You may Need several, but at least two of them to stick your board to the wall.

My son just came around having such a board and I do not have sufficient storage to cover this. So i decided to make a wall Mount and Mount it to the Floor :-)

So, safe storage, and have fun :-)
